# Advent of Code 2018

I'm taking a stab at this challenge. In addition to the puzzles themselves, I think I'm going to try the polyglot approach and use different languages for each day to give me a reason to try them, particularly for the early days when things are conceptually easier.

## Language Options

Some possibilities. Requirement was that they needed to be relatively easy to setup or already present on a Mac. Or there is some easy way to compile/run online. These aren't in any particular order.
