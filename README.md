# Advent of Code 2018

I'm taking a stab at this challenge. In addition to the puzzles themselves, I think I'm going to try the polyglot approach and use different languages for each day to give me a reason to try them, particularly for the early days when things are conceptually easier.

## Language Options

Some possibilities. Requirement was that they needed to be relatively easy to setup or already present on a Mac. Or there is some easy way to compile/run online. These are ordered roughly based on my familiarity with them. And I may or may not take the time to learn some of the ones which I've never used beforeâ€”the bottom seven.
