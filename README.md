# Advent of Code 2018

I'm taking a stab at this challenge. In addition to the puzzles themselves, I think I'm going to try the polyglot approach and use different languages for each day to give me a reason to try them, particularly for the early days when things are conceptually easier.

From Day 11 onward, I will be deciding on a language based on the nature of the problem presented.

## Language Choices

These are all proven languages in this competition (sort of). This is the list I will most likely be choosing from for the remainder of the advent season.

  1. JavaScript -- Definitely my goto for puzzles which don't have massive speed concerns.
  1. C -- If I need the speed then C is there.
  1. C# -- When I need the versatility of the .NET standard library, then C# will be used.
  1. Python -- There may be some cases where Python is more practical than JavaScript.
  1. F# -- If a functional solution seems like the best option, this will be here for me, otherwise still too new.
  1. PHP -- Not sure when PHP would be the best option.
  1. Perl -- Not sure when I'd choose Perl.
  1. Rust -- New hotness, but still too unfamiliar to make it practical.
  1. PowerShell -- Benched for performance reasons. If a puzzle requires me to query AD, then PS is back in the game.
  1. VB .NET -- Can't really do anything C# can't and I'm far less familiar with it.

I also may consider a multi-language solution where I parse the input with a language good at that, like Perl, and then pipe it in a more convenient form into a compiled C program to crunch numbers. Hmm.

### Less Likely Languages

Languages considered but not used due to appropriateness or timeliness. They are all installed on my laptop, so they are all still possibilities if I'm feeling particularly masochistic.

  * Go
  * Pascal
  * C++
  * Bash
  * Ruby
  * Crystal
  * R
  * D
  * Kotlin
